BlackBook
=========

Purpose
-------

This is a small Flask app using AngularJS and Bootstrap to create a contacts book. A little "black book" of sorts.

This project is a small pet learning project I put together to document my experimentation with:

* Creating a restful web api
* Creating a frontend client for said api
* Creating a single-page application that is mobile-friendly.
* Information modeling

This is still currently a work in progress. I can make no guarantee or warranty of the security or stability of it.
Use or re-use at your own risk.


Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7.8 (because of dependencies, does not work with 3 yet.)
* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Flask-WhooshAlchemy
